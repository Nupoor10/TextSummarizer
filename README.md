## ðŸ’» How it Works : 

- The web app takes the user input and flask provides the input to the text summarizer function. 
- The text summarizer function tokenizes the input string into words, removes the stop words and creates a dictionary of word frequency
- The article is then tokenized into sentences and the sentence weight is calculated according to the word frequency table
- The sentence weight value is then divided by the sentence length to get average sentence score
- Finally the sentences having the score above a certain threshold are included in the summary
- The output of the function is served by the flask app to the frontend and the user can see the original text and the summarized text along with the word count
